# Data Mining
The areas covered include association analysis, classification, clustering, text mining, web mining, graph and stream time series mining. 

## What I have learned: 

1	Identify the process of data mining and KDD (Knowledge Discovery from Databases).
2	Analyze the applicability of different data mining and KDD algorithms.
3	Design algorithms to solve problems related to classifications and clustering, as well as identify association rules from a database.
4	Apply the concepts and algorithms of text mining, web mining, graph mining and stream and time series mining.
5	Evaluate the performance of data mining and KDD algorithms.
6	Compare and contrast the performances of different data mining algorithms
7	Evaluate the scalability of data mining algorithms.
8	Analyze the data characteristics that affect the effectiveness of data mining.
9	Examine the limitations of data mining and KDD algorithms
